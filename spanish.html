                <h4>Memorial of an deceased friend I have done for my Spanish project</h4>
                <p>I picked Jeffrey Triplett Jr for my Spanish project memorial because he was a very special friend to me and I loved him as a brother to me. Jeffrey Triplett love to play basketball and to party with his friends and family and to just be around a lot of love. Jeffrey Triplett were born on October 12, 1994 and he died on May 26th, 2012 and he really didn't deserve that because he just wanted to live life, become successful and crack jokes on people to make them laugh when they are feeling down.</p>

                <h4>Emojis</h4>
                <p>This is the project I did in Spanish to try to spread happiness around the school how the people spread happiness around Costa RIca. Me and my peers made an express yourself wall so students, teachers, and staff can write about how they are feeling throughout the day or week. We had used a white board, dry erase markers, emojis, and came up with rules that you can't use any profanity but if so you have to change the words with symbols.</p>
