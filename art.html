                <h4>What Is Glo/Beautiful?</h4>
                <p>The purpose of our project is to make students feel comfortable/great about themselves. Also, when people are feeling down they can look at the mirror to see themslves while hearing people giving compliments to them. We want to make students happy and to love themselves for who they are. Our purpose was to make the mood of our project to be an loving and happy mood.</p>

                <h4>3D Painting This project was to find power behind words</h4>
                <p>In The Change of Your Thoughts I created a painting. The painting is an interpretation of soundwaves based from an audio recording of my voice saying the statement “the change of your thoughts”. I chose this statement because a lot of people never really stick to one thought. Humans are  always changing  thoughts and  coming up with new great ideas. </p>

                <p>Colors add to the overall meaning of the work by impacting  how you feel, adding energy, confidence, happiness, and inspiration. By using yellow I’m trying to grab  attention, stimulating mental activity while balancing it with  a neutral color. </p>

                <h3>Mapping Connection</h3>
                <h4>This project was to connect your story to the place it happened at</h4>
                <p>I want to share the story of when my brother died. To all the young men who have older or younger brothers I want to say to always love them no matter what you guys go through because when they’re gone it’s going to hurt you. It will  take a part of you as well.</p>
                <p>I want the audience to experience the life that I live in my neighborhood and to remember  all the important people I lost in my life. I want the audience to be amazed on how I lost a very special person to me but I  am motivated to still come to school and do the right things in my life. I want to honor the life of my older brother.</p>
            <p> I remember how  my big brother and I  would go outside together and laugh a lot with our friends and family, argue with each other, fight with each other, sleep in the same bed with each other. The most important thing  I remember is all the holiday seasons we shared with our family. The location I chose for my map  is where my big brother’s funeral took place. This location is also   where we lived and always hung out on holidays.I created a work that shows a picture of my older brother who passed away and the funeral home because I will never forget about it and the area where it took place.</p>
