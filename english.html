                <h3>Defining Moment</h3>
                <h4>Where were you all my life?</h4>
                <p>
	 When my father got locked up, I’ve never really had a father figure in my life. He was in and out of jail all  my life. The only time I got to see him and spend time with him was when I was nine years old. My father never did nothing for me I always did things on my own or with the help of my grandfather. I wasn’t taught how life works growing up without my father because I’ve never had anyone to teach me I learned the hard way from my siblings.</p>
               <p>He didn’t even come to my 8th grade graduation and I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t come to my 12th grade graduation. But, I really don’t care because I never got rewarded for the things I did and as I’ve gotten older I don’t need him in my life anymore that's why I’m going to go to college, grind hard, and get the best education I can get to start off my career as a doctor. 
	I realized that my father made me who I am today because now I don’t care about nothing and I just want to live my life so I can take care of my mother and little sisters. That’s why I try to do my best in life and to stay out of everybody’s way to become a successful  young man and a great leader.
</p>
<p>My mother is my defining moment as well because she is the one that pushes me harder and wants me to succeed in life because I’m her only son. I love her for that because she only wants the best from me and not end up in jail or worse, dead. She was the one who taught me how life works as well because she knew my father wasn’t going to be in my life so she use to always say that she is my father and that’s why I look up to her. I really adore my mother because she put food on the table for me and clothes on my back as well  and without her how will I survive? What will I do? My mother is my everything. 
</p>
<p>I can compare my narrative to Andrew Galasetti because he grew up in a single parent household and as he grew older his father slowly drifted away from him. It’s different because his father used to beat on him and his mother but my father never did that, he just walked out my life.
